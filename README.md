Some simple projects from AI issues in translation into Polish.
## Comparison of classical machine learning models and artificial neural networks (MLPs)

>>1. Objective:
>>
>>The goal of the project is to predict the level of carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) emissions from vehicles depending on their characteristics using machine learning algorithms, along with >>analyzing the dataset and comparing the effectiveness of the prediction techniques used.

## Methods:
>>A. Linear regression
>>Linear model used as a basis for evaluating more complex methods,
>>allows quick results while ensuring interpretability.
>>It is simple to implement, but can be less effective for complex data
>>with non-linear relationships.
>>
>>B. K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
>>An algorithm based on classification by nearest neighbors.
>>Due to its simplicity, it is often used in exploratory tasks,
>>Its effectiveness depends on the appropriate choice of the number of neighbors (parameter k)
>>and distance, which makes it sensitive to data scaling.
>>
>>C. MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) - basic model
>>A basic neural network model with two hidden layers.
>>It is capable of solving nonlinear problems by learning complex relationships in data.
>>It is characterized by moderate computational complexity
>>and provides a starting point for more advanced implementations.
>>
>>D. MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) optimized model.
>>An advanced neural network model with multiple hidden layers, optimized
>>in terms of architecture (number of neurons, layers), activation function and hyper parameters,
>>such as learning rate and regularization.
>>It provides high performance and accuracy, especially in tasks requiring
>>analysis of large and complex data sets.
