1 Objective.
The purpose of the exercise was to apply supervised learning techniques to predict the value of median
real estate prices in Boston (MEDV column) based on available characteristics describing the data
socioeconomic and demographic data, in particular using linear regression. The exercise also included the introduction of regularization (ridge regression, Lasso and ElasticNet) to improve the efficiency of the model.


```Data sets:
The data used in the task is a set describing real estate prices in Boston, consisting of 506 rows
and 13 descriptive characteristics, including CRIM (crime rate), RM (average number of rooms) or LSTAT
(percentage of poor residents).
The predicted feature was MEDV, representing the median property value
in thousands of dollars.
CRIM - the city's crime rate,
ZN - percentage of “large plots of land” - greater than 2,500 m2,
INDUS - percentage of industrial sites in the city,
CHAS - if the site is next to the Charles River -1, otherwise 0,
NOX - concentration of nitrogen oxides,
RM - average number of rooms in a building,
AGE - percentage of “old buildings” - built before 1940,
DIS - weighted distance from job centers in Boston,
RAD - accessibility index to major roads,
TAX - property tax value calculated on $10,000,
PTRATIO - ratio of students per teachers in the city,
B - percentage of people of African-American descent,
LSTAT - percentage of residents classified as poor (percentage of poverty),
MEDV - median value of homes from a given area (in thousands of dollars).
