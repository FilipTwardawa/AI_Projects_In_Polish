Some simple projects from AI issues in translation into Polish.

## APPLICATION OF NEURAL NETWORKS AND DEEP LEARNING

>> 1. Objective:
>> 
>>The goal of our project is to build effective deep learning models,
>>that will be able to classify images from the “CIFAR-10” dataset.

## Methods:
>> A. Base CNN Model.
>> 
>>This is a basic model based on convolutional neural networks(CNN).
>>It contains several convolutional and pooling layers, which makes it possible to extract the key features of the images. The model has a relatively simple architecture, which allows >>for quick training and initial results.
>>Due to the limited number of layers, the model can have difficulty
>>capturing more complex patterns in the data.

>>B. Intermediate CNN Model
>>The second model is an extension of the base model.
>>It contains more convolutional layers and a larger number of neurons in the dense layer,
>>which allows for more accurate extraction of image features and improved accuracy of classification.

>>C. Optimized CNN Model.
>>The most advanced model in the project, which uses techniques such as batch normalization (Batch Normalization) and dropout, which allows for improve generalization and reduce >>overtraining. The model has been optimized also in terms of the number of layers, the number of neurons and the activation function. Thanks to it achieves high performance in image >>classification.
